<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046754/">The Barefoot Contessa</a> was on TV tonight.  I came into it late, and couldn't figure out what was happening.  Great fun to watch though.  Bogie is unique.  I leave you with a quote from the movie about the lonely times in life:<br/><blockquote><br/>... there are no days and nights in it, just days that turn black when the sun goes down.<br/></blockquote></div>
