I'm in two small pools regarding the tournament.  It makes the whole thing so exciting.<br/><br/>The matchups so far have been not bad.  Wichita St. beat Seton Hall in a blowout.  Florida beat Southern Alabama in an unsurprising game.  I got these right.  Oklahoma lost in an upset to Wisc. Milwaukee.  I got this wrong, but apparently so did the experts.  :)<br/><br/>BC won over Pacific in <em>double overtime</em>.  This was such an exciting game.  I called this, but I must say it was much too close for my comfort.  It was tied 65-65 at the end of regulation.  With two three pointers in overtime, Pacific brought it to 71-65.  Then BC brought it to 71-69, and Pacific made another three for 74-69.  BC made a three to get it to 74-72.  Then, with seconds left BC's Smith made the tying free throws.  (He apparently is not so good with the free throws.)  The second overtime was relatively anticlimactic, but BC managed to pull it out.<br/><br/>What was perhaps the most interesting was the Tennessee and Winthrop matchup.  Believe it or not, I said Winthrop would win this.  I might be the only person too.  And it was a close game, the whole way.  It was tied 61-61 in the final minutes.  Then with 3 seconds left, Tennessee had possession, put it up, and damn it was good.  Winthrop had 0.4 seconds left on the clock to get <em>all the way</em> down court and score.  Obviously, this did not happen, but they tried valiantly.  Final score was 63-61.  I didn't call this game right, but I was close.  :)<br/><br/>In another uninteresting upset, Montana beat Nevada.  More interesting though was the Alabama win over Marquette.  It was a 1 point game with 20 seconds to go, but Alabama pulled out a 5 point game.  I got these both wrong.  :(<br/><br/>So far, I've got 3 out of 7.  I'm not doing so hot.  I guess that's what happens when you don't regularly follow basketball...  Fortunately I had none of these losing teams winning more than one game.<br/><br/>Everyone else having fun with the basketball? :)</div>
