Sometimes I wish Lifehacker did a little bit more research. [Here's a
graphic](http://lifehacker.com/this-graphic-shows-how-to-keep-your-browsing-email-an-1084193239)
ostensibly showing how to secure your online communication.

I'm no expert, but let's go through some of these recommendations.

DuckDuckGo... no. As has been [revealed
recently](http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/06/25/ssl-intercepted-today-decrypted-tomorrow.html),
they are essentially an open book to intelligence agencies. If you want
security, use Google!

FireFox... yes. Good suggestion.

Opera... no. See
[here](http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/06/25/ssl-intercepted-today-decrypted-tomorrow.html).

Tor... too much work and [probably not
effective](http://boingboing.net/2013/08/04/anonymous-web-host-shut-down.html).

Chrome... what is with the unsubstantiated (and as far as I know) false rumor?

HTTPS everywhere... yes. Good suggestion.

Secure email... [are there any services
left?](http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/10/4608664/lavabit-founder-closed-his-secure-email-service-to-protect-the)
and [were they ever really
secure?](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/11/hushmail-to-war/)

Avoid hotspots... really???

Encryption... may be a good idea, but probably not [truly
effective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law#United_States) since the government can always jail you until you tell them the key.

And what's with the repeated mention of advertising. Who cares if ads are displayed? This is supposed to be about keeping your communication private, not about preventing advertising.
