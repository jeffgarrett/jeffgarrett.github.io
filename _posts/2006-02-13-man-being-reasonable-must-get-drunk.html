<div class='post'>
My flatmate arrived home at 1 a.m., a little bit intoxicated.  Scratch that, very intoxicated.  Speaking of such, did you know that the National Women's Christian Temperance Union headquarters is located in Evanston?  I just learned this.<br/><br/>(Oh and the post title is from Lord Byron.  In the interest of fairness, let's also give Seneca his say.  He said, "Nihil aliud est ebrietas quam voluntaria insania."  Translated, that reads, "Drunkenness is nothing but voluntary madness.")</div>
