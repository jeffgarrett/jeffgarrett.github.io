My last post was a bit whiny, but I'd like to expound on the usage of flash in Google Music, and why it gives choppy music on many of my machines. &nbsp;This is something of a study in why you should avoid flash at all costs...<br /><br />And really, an oft-quoted reason, the lack of flash support on iOS is not all that good a reason by itself unless the website is targeting mobile platforms. &nbsp;iOS accounts for about two percent of web traffic, so it is entirely possible to ignore them.<br /><br />I can give you a much better reason. &nbsp;<a href="http://k001.livejournal.com/791690.html">Just read this.</a>&nbsp; That's the reason flash is choppy on some of my machines (and there's a workaround I have been too lazy to use everywhere). &nbsp;The gist is that there is a bug in the 64-bit flash plugin having to do with playing audio (uncovered because other things became less lenient), and resulting in choppy audio. &nbsp;Even though this is a closed product, some very smart people figured out exactly what the problem was, created a workaround, and reported the problem to Adobe. &nbsp;The true fix is literally is as simple as replacing one function call with another similar one.<br /><br />That was in November 2010. &nbsp;Adobe still has not fixed it. &nbsp;What does that say to website developers? &nbsp;Yes, you are presenting what is at best an irritating experience to people unfortunate enough to come to your site. &nbsp;And yes, someone else already did the work to figure out why. &nbsp;And yes, we can fix it easily. &nbsp;But we won't.<br /><br />On a more positive note, the workaround does fix it completely. &nbsp;:)</div>
