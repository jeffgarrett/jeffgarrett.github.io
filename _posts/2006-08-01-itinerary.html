<div class='post'>
For the Csima wedding, I'll be arriving Wednesday at 10:30 a.m.  I'll fly out Sunday at 6:45 p.m.  Plan accordingly.  :)<br/><br/>For the Zbarsky's, I'll come in to Chicago Friday night, and leave Monday night.  If anyone wants to hang out or such...<br/><br/>(Anti-recommendation: Don't use Travelocity.  Pain in the butt.  Orbitz is much better.)</div>
