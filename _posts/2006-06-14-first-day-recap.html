<div class='post'>
Before my first day at junior high, I was so anxious I couldn't sleep.  I awoke at 4:30 a.m., got dressed, gathered my things, and ate breakfast.  Then I faced several hours of waiting before I could go.  My point is I'm high strung.<br/><br/>I've been antsy for a couple of weeks.  Waiting to see if I'd get the job...  Waiting to see exactly what I'd be doing...  Waiting to see if I could do it...  It all makes day one that much more fun.  I didn't get so much sleep the night before.  I misjudged the traffic factor and arrived a few minutes early.  I filled out some paperwork in the morning.  I couldn't get my key yet.  M showed me around.  Our team communicates via IRC.  (Isn't that perfect?  I spend all day on IRC.)  I was charged with some simple tasks.  Unfortunately the network had issues and we spent a while unsuccessfully trying to track them down.  So that was pretty much my day.</div>
