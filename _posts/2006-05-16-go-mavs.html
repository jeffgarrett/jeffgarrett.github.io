The Dallas Mavericks are hot right now!  There are three series yet undecided in this round.  Dallas is soundly thumping San Antonio 3-1.  The Detroit vs. Cleveland and Phoenix vs. LA Clippers series are closer at 2-2 and 3-2 respectively.  I'm presently at last place in our pool, 19 points down from the lead, but I'm still in it.  The key is Dallas.  Only I have Dallas winning the whole tournament.  But even if things go as close to my bracket as possible, I'll only win by 7 points.  It's still anyone's game.<br/><br/>Dallas is <em>essential</em> for me.  If they don't win the whole shebang, I am mathematically eliminated.  The <em>only</em> series for which I picked a different winner from anyone else (excluding Jayadev) are the Dallas series.  Since I'm so far back, these are evidently very important.  The tricky part is both Elizabeth and Linda also have Dallas getting all the way to the final.  And even if Dallas wins it all, their point totals will be very near mine.  (They are currently ahead of me.)<br/><br/>So to analyze my chances, let's assume Dallas will win it all and see how I stack up against Elizabeth and Linda.  Presently, Elizabeth is 19 points and Linda is 12 points ahead of me.  The Dallas series this round won't make a difference.  We all said it'd last 7 games, so we'll all get the same points from it.  The Dallas series next round will be interesting.  Linda and I said it'd last 4 games, and Elizabeth said it'd last 7 games.  So I will gain 4 points relative to Elizabeth if it really only lasts 4 games.  (If it takes 6 or 7 games she will gain more over me.)  Then there's the final.  I'll gain between 17 and 21 points on the both of them.<br/><br/>Then there are the other series.  Elizabeth and I both said the current Detroit series would go 5 games, and Linda said 6.  If Detroit does win, it'll take either 6 or 7 games.  This means Linda will gain another 2 or 4 points relative to me.  Then in the next round, I said Detroit would win in 4, Elizabeth said 6, and Linda said 7.  So if this is a short series, I have the chance to gain some more points on them.  (On the longshot Detroit loses this round to Cleveland, this whole discussion is moot, and none of us get any points.  But I have friends rooting for Detroit, so let's hope not!  A Dallas vs. Detroit final would be fun.)<br/><br/>Then there's the Phoenix vs. LA Clippers game this round.  We all have Phoenix winning it, and if they do it'll take 6 or 7 games and I'll lose on both of them.  It'd be preferrable if the Clippers won.  Aside from not falling further behind, it might make for a short Dallas series next round.  And it's always fun to root for an upset team.  (GEORGE MASON!)<br/><br/>I really need Dallas to win the final.  Even so, my fate is not guaranteed.<br/><br/>Tomorrow, Liz and Nick are hosting poker.  It's the first time since <em>the incident</em>.  I hope they have cable so we can watch the games.<br/><br/>Oh and by the way, I probably won't be in Chicago for very long.  Cheers.</div>
