<div class='post'>
Suppose one has a GUI app that does the occassional network I/O--and that's about it.  Right now it wakes up 5 times a second to poll.  What's the best way to keep it sleeping?  Seems to me the I/O should be moved to a separate thread and done pretty much synchronously.  Then it can reliably be put to sleep.<br/><br/>Agh, this will take time.</div>
