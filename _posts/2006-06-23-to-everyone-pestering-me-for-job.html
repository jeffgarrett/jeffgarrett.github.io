So far things are going well.  My main responsibility seems to be a combination of installation and support.  We deal mainly with huge clusters.  There are some lone machines that come through though.  Our team installs and configures the software and tests the machines before they ship.  Sometimes there's a problem and we troubleshoot it.<br/><br/>We also get malfunctioning machines from customers that we have to troubleshoot.  I haven't yet dived in to the actual customer support.</div>
