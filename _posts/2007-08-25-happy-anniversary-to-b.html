Oh, it was only one year ago that I rode public transportation to change into a tux in the church bathroom.  And then of course change back in the bathroom of the hotel where the reception was held.  I made fun of the D.J. wearing orange, and my street clothes included a red T-shirt.  :)  I missed the Total Eclipse of the Heart dance...  Ah, memories.</div>
