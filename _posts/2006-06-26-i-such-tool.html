I thought <em>almost</em> all the relevant people knew I was in a different state.  Of course, I didn't shout from the rooftops my intention to move.  My flatmates didn't know the exact date of my exodus until 3 days prior.  The Csima's didn't know more than about a week prior.  Rob knew a few weeks prior.  It seemed to get out though.  It's a small community.  After all, RY was at the little farewell pub outing.  I figured that meant it had spread to the office crowd.  I took my stuff from the office, which I heard was a concern of KP's.  It would seem however that the Z's didn't know.  They learned when asking for an address for the wedding invitation!<br/><br/>I was aware I didn't give a lot of warning, but I suppose I thought most people knew.  Of course, RW had no way to know, and I didn't have time to specifically seek her out.  I hope she can forgive me.</div>
