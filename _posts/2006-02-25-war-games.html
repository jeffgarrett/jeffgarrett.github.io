On TV tonight was the classic 1983 movie starring Matthew Broderick.  It's the one with the negative affirmation:  sometimes it's best to give up.  My Russian flatmate had never seen it before.</div>

Being something of a computer geek, it&#39;s also fun to remember the era of acoustic modems and wardialing--although I&#39;m a bit too young to have experienced it the first time through.</div>

A classic. The surrealist aspect of teaching an artificial intelligence the difference between fantasy and reality is fascinating. Good performances from both Broderick and Sheedy, although the latter has fallen from grace...</div>
