<div class='post'>
I came in early as people requested, and stayed late. 10 am - 3 am. Helped people with algebra, which was fun and nice... Other people weren't doing so well (however other people didn't skip the earlier hw's this week)...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/rjyoung/">rjyoung</a> was a bit grumpy. <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/pessimysticism/">pessimysticism</a> was a bit frustrated.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/sugardickdaddy/">sugardickdaddy</a> had his father visit on a business trip, must've been fun.<br/><br/>Karen enjoyed last night, which is good... And we all enjoyed her presence.<br/><br/>Switching gears, I worry that I was a bit too smug today. I was trying to be helpful, but with all the "this is easy" statements, I may have been and/or appeared so at times.</div>
