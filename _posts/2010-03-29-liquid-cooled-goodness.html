So I decided to play around with this liquid cooling idea...  I have a small case though, so I went with the Exos-v2 external radiator/fan/pump combo.<br/><br/>My Core i7 used to boot at ~35C and then quickly be in the 35-40C and then shortly after boot it would be very stable at 40-45C.  As far as I know, I didn't see it exceed 60C under load...  But I'm not sure if I was looking when I really exercised it.<br/><br/>Now with this liquid cooled thingamajig, it stays below 40C at idle which is nice, but under load it can easily get above 60C and I can push it to just above 70C.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I didn't record good data before installing the cooling.<br/><br/>So what gives?  Am I imagining things or is this too hot?</div>
