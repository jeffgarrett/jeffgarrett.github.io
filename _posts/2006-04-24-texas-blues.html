<div class='post'>
There's a song I like.  I heard it attributed to a Texan blues singer.  I think it was Mance Lipscomb, but I'm not sure.  I haven't found it among his songs, as far as I can tell online.  I heard it covered by some band on Prairie Home Companion, probably in 2003.  The leitmotif of the song is "chains."  Any help?</div>
