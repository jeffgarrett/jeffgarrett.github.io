Poker for the first time in 4 months was wholly underwhelming.  Nick and I were first out.  We played Boggle before going back to a cash game.  Rob, George and I left last at about 4 a.m.  This was last Wednesday.<br/><br/>Friday we watched basketball at the pub.  We even cajoled Bert and Elizabeth into coming.  Afterward I came back to my apartment filled with the "worms crowd."<br/><br/>Yesterday we sought out Sheffield's for the basketball.  The Dallas game was amazing!  With 30 seconds left in the first quarter, the Spurs made an amazing shot to be up by 3.  This was the first time they led <em>all game</em>.  Good timing, eh?  With little over 20 seconds left, Dirk tried a layup.  All the Spurs had to do was not foul!  He'd get his two points, they'd have possession, and they could run out the clock.  And they'd win.  But Ginobili fouls Dirk (the 90% free throw shooter, mind you), and the game was tied at the end of the 4th.  Thank you Ginobili!  Dallas dominated in overtime, and thankfully live to see another day.<br/><br/>My sister is flying in today.  Actually she was going to arrive at 9 a.m., but that flight was canceled.  Instead, she'll arrive at 3 p.m.  She'll be leaving tomorrow.<br/><br/>Ordinarily, today would be pool, but as my sister's in town I'm not going.  I'm not even playing this session anyways.<br/><br/>Thursday, the Csima's are having me over for dinner.  Should be fun.  And I'm leaving this god-forsaken place very soon now.  Moving south for <em>summer</em>?  I have a lot of crap to do.</div>
