<div class='post'>
I had an excellent time yesterday. I came into the office and I got some work done, with Karen and Anne. Then we went to see "Bowling for Columbine". Very good movie, although its effects were greater than I imagined. Led to some tense moments at the pub (where we went after the movie).<br/><br/>Anyways, I probably can't make it to the office til 2pm unfortunately today, but I will be in.</div>
