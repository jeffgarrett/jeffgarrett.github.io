I ran across "<a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5323075780064678586&amp;postID=5783764111413600437">The ﬂat locus of Brauer-Severi ﬁbrations of smooth orders</a>" today.  It reminded me of a problem I once found very interesting:<br /><br />Given a quasi-compact separated scheme X, is Br(X) = H<sup>2</sup>(X,<b>G</b><sub>m</sub>)<sub>tors</sub>?  There are some examples of non-separated (but even semi-separated) schemes for which this is not true.</div>
