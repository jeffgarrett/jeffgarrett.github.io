I make an awesome pork chop.  Paprika is the secret.  I just season the pork with salt and paprika and then fry it in olive oil.  It's quick, easy and cheap.  From here to eternity, I imagine I'll always have tons of pork in the freezer.  I just buy the really cheap cuts, less than $2 a pound.  Then it's there when I need it.  No thought.  No effort.<br/><br/>My flatmates know my secret now.  I've shared some pork chops with Q and N.  They now each know exactly one use for paprika.  Yesterday, Q tried to emulate my pork chops.  He bought his own paprika from the store.  (I don't know why he can't use mine.  We keep all our spices together in a shared cabinet.)  With that, he fried some boneless loin cuts and made a side of rice.  (As it turns out, he overcooked the pork a bit.  I think it's tempting to do that.  It tasted alright though.)  He really went gung ho!</div>
