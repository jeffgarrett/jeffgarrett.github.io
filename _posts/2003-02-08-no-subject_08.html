After reading <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/pessimysticism/">pessimysticism</a>'s recent entry, I think I should read some Calvino... or any fiction really. I noticed a conspicuous absence, that of Tolstoy, in his entry....<br/><br/>Anyways, last night bowling was fun. (Unfortunately) a lot of people left after the first game. But me and my peeps played a rousing second game. I got two strikes in a row and as I went up to make my next shot, the lane broke. We waited and it got fixed, and I of course did not get a third strike, and then it broke right after my shot, we waited some more and changed lanes and so on... In the end, we had fun (modulo a little waiting) and got bowling for free (modulo the shoe fees). Everyone owes Mr. G $2 or about.<br/><br/>Tonight we shall go see "Bowling for Columbine", a theme weekend if you will.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I think I shall visit the office soon (noonish?) see if anyone's there, and maybe read a little fiction...</div>

I haven&#39;t read any tolstoy in four years, that&#39;s why. Maybe I should, but I&#39;m in the middle of like, four books right now, and not making fast progress. Maybe over spring break.</div>
