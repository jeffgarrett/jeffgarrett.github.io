<a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2006/02/15/BL2006021501989.html'>A piece talking about high school algebra</a> was recently published by the Washington Post.  It's a  decent satire I think.  And it's gotten a rise out of people who take it seriously.  The <a href='http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=wrong_answer&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1'>Scientific American blog</a> responds with facts and studies for example.  I think someone should write an equally humorous piece about the uselessness of English writing classes, but alas I'm not in the mood.<br/><br/>Come on!  A writer who doesn't even know the meaning of the word "reasoning"?  Even with access to computers and dictionaries?  The example of algebra's uselessness being a simple problem of <em>exactly</em> the sort any manager might need.  An argument that is <em>sui generis</em> and utterly devoid of reasoning skills?  At the same time he suggests writing is the ultimate form of reasoning?<br/><br/>It has to be a satire!</div>
