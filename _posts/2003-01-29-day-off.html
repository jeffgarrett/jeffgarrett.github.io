I pretty much took a day off today as far as what I'm supposed to do goes... And we're going out to the pub (not our usual one either), to get drunk, should be fun.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, c'est la vie.</div>

The pub outing went well.<br>Lots of innapropriate social behavior, tactless questions and implications, embarrasments, etc.<br>Anne bought me a drink... how unmanly of me. Anyway, it was fun.</div>
