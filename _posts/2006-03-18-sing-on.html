I got a little tired writing about all the results, so I'll give up on that.  What's a little surprising is that I'm still second in our little pool.  And in most cases, my losses weren't huge ones.  Today I chose A&M to win, mainly because of the Texas connection.  And as with every team I chose, they were winning with about 2 seconds left.  And they lost!  Oh well.<br/><br/>Rob and I are actually in two pools together.  There's the small one he started with U of C math people.  Then there's the one at the place we play pool.  Supposedly this one's pretty big, with people from many bars and such playing in it.  Unfortunately, we can't tell how that's going...<br/><br/>In the midst of all this fun, Niles has had friends and his brother over for his "bachelor party."  A bunch of annoying drunk people...  There is a bright side:  Mitya is out of town and everyone else will sleep soundly.  Thus, I can leave my tunes playing while I drift off to sleep:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Operator won’t you put me on through<br/>I gotta send my love down to baton rouge<br/>Hurry up won’t you put her on the line<br/>I gotta talk to the girl just one more time.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>OK, so it's not "Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose," but who are you to judge?  I'm from Texas, damnit.</div>
