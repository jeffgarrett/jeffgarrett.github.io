I saw my brother's new house this weekend.  Quite nice!  They closed on it the Friday before Labor Day but are still working on the painting and, this weekend, replacing doors.  I hadn't seen it before this Saturday.  There's a nicely sized backyard which abuts a wooded creek bed area.  There's a fairly large unfinished area under the house.  There's three rooms, one of which will be a study, and two which will be bedrooms.  And there's one bathroom, a living area, the kitchen and a two car garage.  Very cool.<br/><br/>The wedding's only 3 weeks away!</div>
