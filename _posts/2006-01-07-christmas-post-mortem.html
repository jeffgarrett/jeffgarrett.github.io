Where are the snowdens of yesteryear?  Or for that matter, the good movies?  The ones with ensemble casts, or at least developed supporting characters; the ones that brashly surpass the 170 minute running time, and that despite following <em>so many others</em> are based on some World War II story; the ones where <em>almost all</em> of the lead characters die?  I just watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057115/">The Great Escape</a>.<br/><br/>My sister's car was recovered Thursday after a high speed chase.  they used it to steal from construction sites, dented in the top of the car with heavy stuff, probably totalled<br/><br/>Friday morning marked my return.  I absolutely <em>love</em> flying in the morning.  My flight departed at 7 a.m., so I was up two hours earlier.  Unsurprisingly, the plane was only about half full.  I had an empty seat beside me.  The cabin lights were off the entire flight.  Everyone was silent but for one oblivious infant in the back.  It felt surreal.<br/><br/>It was 30 or so when I got here.  Rather than 70 or so in Texas.<br/><br/>La la la</div>
