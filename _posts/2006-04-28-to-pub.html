So I should let you know that my laptop now works.  I had talked to Dell technical support at about 5 p.m. on Tuesday, and Thursday morning my laptop hard drive arrived.  That's a pleasant surprise.  I quickly installed it, then worked on installing my preferred operating system.  This took a little bit longer than it should have, but I eventually got everything set.<br/><br/>Tonight, we went to the pub.  We went to watch basketball.  Rob, Bert, Elizabeth, George, Matt and Christina came.  I was being overly "social" though.  I was hanging out with some people nearer the pool table and more willing to play pool.  The people were trying to hook me up with one of their female friends.<br/><br/>Amused...</div>
