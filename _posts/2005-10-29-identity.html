The top Google hit for "Jeff Garrett" used to be one of my pages.  A very old and tendentious one, if i recall, but still mine.  I have had an Internet presence for 10 years or more, after all.  Now you can't even find me!  :-)<br/><br/>I've not had a blog for as long -- only about 3 years.  The top Google hit for "Jeff Garrett blog" is unsurprisingly not mine.  But still, <a href="http://jgarrett.blogspot.com/">check it out</a>.  At least people can tell us apart.  :-)</div>
