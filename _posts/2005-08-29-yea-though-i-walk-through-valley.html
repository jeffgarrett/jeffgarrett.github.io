I had a weird dream the other night.  The whole dream was unusually vivid.  The dream started at a store, very much like a bookstore, with lots of shelves, everything a light brown color.  The place reminded me of Barnes & Noble or Borders.  It was generic.  It could've been a Hallmark store just as easily.  I was there to get a greeting card, so I used a computer display in the store to make a personalized card.  I don't remember why I wanted a greeting card, but it seemed an important enough reason at the time.<br/><br/>Once I secured the card, I had to go upstairs to buy stamps.  This store was on the 28th floor so I got into the elevator to go up one floor.  Unfortunately when I got in the elevator, it was but a shell of a car.  Its walls were the plain metal exterior of the car.  Its wiring was exposed.  Its lights didn't seem to work.  I began to worry.  As it turns out, it was not a working elevator, and I plunged all 28 stories down to my death.<br/><br/>Now, although odd, at this point the dream's not entirely shocking.  I've had my share of dreams where I die, or come close to dying, both at the hands of others and of purely natural causes.  I've been shot at by a sniper, I've been chased down by anthropomorphic lightning...  But I usually wake up--breathing heavily.  It's supposed to be a nightmare.  Not this time!<br/><br/>Although dead in the elevator, I did not wake up.  The dream calmly continued.  I--now dead--was suddenly back in the store.  My sister was there and I was attempting to say goodbye, although she was rather bored with me and walked away.  My mom was also there.  Then quite suddenly I was no longer in the store.  I was walking out of a house, through a patio.  The patio had a covering with wooden supports, painted white, and thin wooden lattice work between the supports.  I was walking with other people in a single-file line.  The only recognizable person in the group was Jesus!  Although he was not what you may imagine of Jesus.  He was white, middle-aged, with short brownish-grey hair, wearing glasses, sandals, and a robe--a bath robe.  He had a small face with tight muscles.  I could see the veins near his temples and the wrinkles near his eyes.<br/><br/>I said to him that I couldn't recall if I had repented before death and apologized if I had.  He said I had.  We continued walking in silence.  <em>Then</em> I woke up.</div>
