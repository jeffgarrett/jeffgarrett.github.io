My Twitter account languishes mostly unused. It's a funny story. I was stranded in Texas last Christmas trying to make it to the northeast. So I signed up for Twitter to follow the timely news from the airlines. That was immensely useful.&nbsp;Since then a few friends have joined Twitter, but they're mostly on Google+ now. So I asked myself what do I need twitter for?<br /><br />In fact, there's only one stream of updates I would really miss:&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/NY_NJairports">NY_NJairports</a>, my favorite source of New York area airport information. I also occasionally find the&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/AmtrakNEC">AmtrakNEC</a>&nbsp;stream useful, but I don't know that I'd miss it.<br /><br />Here's the trick:&nbsp;<a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2011/06/23/how-to-find-the-rss-feed-for-any-twitter-user/">you can follow Twitter feeds via RSS</a>. I regularly check Google Reader, so that's perfect!</div>
