<div class='post'>
Having spent 8 or 9 hours on Monday dealing with that catastrophe, much of it in the company of CC, I didn't much feel like doing anything yesterday.  Today, I still would rather not, but I have some Freudian issues with a washer/dryer in the middle of the kitchen.  The workmen are downstairs, but CC said she wanted to be here when they fixed the drywall.  I left a message.  She hasn't called back.</div>
