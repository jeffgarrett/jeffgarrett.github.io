To start posting more regularly, I'll start a series on small pet peeves with Google products.<br /><br />Let's start with Google Drive. Google Drive can support archive file formats but only zip and rar <a href="http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2423485">according to the support page</a>.<br /><br />It should therefore be easy to add support for more archive formats, but notably missing are tar-based formats. Why not include uncompressed tar, and tar compressed with gzip, bzip2, and xz?<br /><br />Finally, I end with two questions whose answers are not obvious: does Drive's search functionality extend to documents included in an archive? And, can archives within archives be viewed as easily?</div>
