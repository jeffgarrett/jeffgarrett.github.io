Easy algebra this week, I've already got it done. I'll be able to get sleep. I even have part of Monday's analysis done maybe. Kate and I worked on the algebra and part of the analysis. I'm trying to steal Kate away from 'Mohammed's people'. She will soon be known as one of Jeff's people, muahahaha. Speaking of which, haven't yet tried to get Kate to skip class, need to do that soon, there's $1 riding on it.<br/><br/>Now sleep, or champs algebriques? oh, and spastelstein's (that's probably horribly misspelled) proof of quasi-injective resolutions for unbounded complexes of sheaves, leaves a bit to be desired...</div>
