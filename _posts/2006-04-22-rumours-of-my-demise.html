<div class='post'>
To make a long story short, my laptop died.  Actually, it seems the hard drive died.  (It was my fault, but I won't get into that.)  As a result, my access to jgarrett was hampered until now.<br/><br/>Anyways, I've been having a great few weeks, lately.  I'll avoid getting saccharine about it, but I'm beginning to build a better appreciation...  (Good luck if you can figure out what I'm talking about!  In 2 weeks, I probably won't even know.)<br/><br/>I've been keeping in touch with that prospie who e-mailed me a while back.  He decided to come.  I'm somewhat curious how he found me.  Anyways, because of a lack of access to my primary e-mail, I had to get inventive in figuring out how to respond to his last e-mail (which is on my now dead laptop).  I googled, and he has a myspace page.  So now do I (so I could message him).  That's in the category of things I doubt I'll ever think about again.  My brother has a myspace page even...<br/><br/>I should get back to real life now that I've checked this off my to-do list.</div>
