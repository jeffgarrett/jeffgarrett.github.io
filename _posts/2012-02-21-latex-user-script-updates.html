I posted a minor update to the LaTeX for Blogger <a href="https://github.com/jeffgarrett/browser-extensions/wiki/Assorted-Browser-Extensions">user script</a> to fix it in Blogger's new editor.<br /><br /><br /><img align="middle" alt="\int_0^1 x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}" border="0" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cint_0%5E1%20x%5E2%20dx%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D" /></div>

Thanks for testing so quickly. :)<br /><br />I had tested with a recent unstable version of Chrome on Linux (with draft.blogger.com).<br /><br />Testing on FF 10, as that is convenient, the buttons show up intermittently (i.e. the buttons may show on refresh if not on initial load). When they show, they work.<br /><br />I can look at this more tonight. It looks like a problem on load.</div>
