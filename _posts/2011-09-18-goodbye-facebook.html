<div class='post'>
I planned to wait until Google+ is officially open, but enough time has passed. I deleted my Facebook account!<br /><br />You can <a href="https://plus.google.com/106081268141405424411">find me on Google+</a>.<br /><br />Facebook intentionally hides away the option to delete your account, but if you'd like to do the same&nbsp;<a href="https://ssl.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account&amp;__a=3">use this form</a>.</div>
