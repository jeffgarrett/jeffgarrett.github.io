<div class='post'>
Sis stayed until today.  I put her on the bus to the airport a few hours ago.<br/><br/>As it turned out, pool didn't start until next week.  It's not even clear it's going to happen--there aren't many teams interested.<br/><br/>People want to do things tomorrow.  Q and N want to have dinner.  Then Rob and everyone else want to go out.</div>
