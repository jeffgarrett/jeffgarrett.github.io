<div class='post'>
I had a pretty nice copy of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.  I got it from this little bookstore in Terrell, Texas.  For some reason which evades me now, my family and I went to Tyler, Texas (of Toadies song fame).  On the way back, we stopped at a strip mall in Terrell.  I found this little bookstore.  I didn't recognize the name, but the store had 3 or 4 other locations.  I have a habit of buying books on trips.  I don't like souvenirs, and I don't vacation well, so I suppose it's a compromise.  It gives me something to read on the way back, and a way to remember the trip.  I bought THND in Terrell.  I bought Sister Carrie at the Baylor bookstore.  I bought Lucky at an airport.<br/><br/>The point of this is:  I can't find THND now!  I thought I brought it to Chicago.  But I don't see it anywhere.</div>
