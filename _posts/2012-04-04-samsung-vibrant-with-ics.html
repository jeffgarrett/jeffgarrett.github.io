I have heard some horror stories when switching between custom ROM series. So just to be safer, I went through the <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Samsung_Vibrant:_Full_Update_Guide">CM7.2-rc1</a>&nbsp;release candidate as an intermediate step.<br /><br />It was fairly painless. Of course, always start with a backup. I highly recommend <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup">Titanium Backup</a>&nbsp;for apps and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zegoggles.smssync">SMS Backup+</a> for SMS and call logs, though given my use of Google Voice the latter is not as important. Titanium can upload to Dropbox which is a bit of insurance against the worst case. I temporarily disabled two-factor authentication on my accounts where I use Google Authenticator as a second factor, so as to not lock me out if I bricked my phone. :) All my Google data is synced into the cloud. Finally, I also highly recommend&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xmarks.com/">Xmarks</a>&nbsp;for bookmark syncing between all devices. Because of that, my bookmarks are also all safe in the cloud. Just one last sync, and that was it.<br /><br />Then came the fun part! I downloaded CM7.2-rc1&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Samsung_Vibrant:_Full_Update_Guide">from the link on the CM wiki.</a>&nbsp;I used ClockworkMod ROM manager to download the Google apps package. I booted into recovery to install. And then, uh, it got in a loop constantly rebooting. Pull out the battery to stop the loop and boot again. :) Just to be a little more sure of the state, I used the "install zip from sdcard" option to again install CM7.2-rc1 and the Google apps. Reboot and... Android 2.3!<br /><br />That was simple enough I then downloaded the <a href="http://get.cm/?device=vibrantmtd&amp;type=nightly">CM9 nightly</a> and Google apps package again, and used "install zip from sdcard" in the recovery. I had no issues, and a few reboots later I have Android 4.0!<br /><br />I'm having fun in ICS. It is chewing through the battery though.<br /><br />YMMV, of course. Happy flashing!</div>
