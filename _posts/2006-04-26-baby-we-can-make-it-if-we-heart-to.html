Tuesday I crossed off most of my to-do list.  In the process, I learned a lesson:<br/><br/><em>Don't</em> call Dell technical support.  <em>Ever</em>.  I learned this the hard way.  I called them, spent a little over half an hour giving personal information and describing the problem to a lady with one of the thickest Indian accents I've ever heard.  This included giving my phone number, so she could call back if we got disconnected.  Great idea!  Poorly implemented:  as we were discussing the problem at hand, the connection was dropped.  No one called back.  So I tried calling again.  This time I got a guy, also clearly Indian, but with a much milder accent.  He also seemed to know what he was doing.  We got to the same part in the conversation before the connection was dropped, again.  Naturally, he never called me back either.  And I had no ticket number, and nothing had been started to actually <em>resolve</em> my problem.  This is precisely why I had put off this call...<br/><br/>So at this point, frustrated, I tried Dell's online technical support.  The lady was very helpful.  Even though it took an hour, and her responses lagged considerably, it was infinitely better.  I should have a part coming in a few days.<br/><br/>With a great feeling of accomplishment, I arrived at the CP for our pool league.  It was the last week of regular play.  Next week starts the playoffs.  We're in the playoffs, but so is everyone else.  (Our division only has 6 teams.  The first team automatically advances, and the next 4 have these playoffs.)  Anyways, we're having trouble with attendance.  One of our guys is captain of a softball team.  One is being flaky for unknown reasons.<br/><br/>The highlight of the day was the ride home.  On the southbound red line, three girls entered at some downtown stop.  One said, "Hey, look what James wrote," and pulled out a small note and began to read it aloud:<br/><blockquote><br/>Dear Lola,<br/><br/>Your absence is like being hit in the ankle with a blunt object.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I grant you that being hit in the ankle with a blunt object must hurt, but when thinking of potentially painful things, is this the first one that pops into your mind?  I had trouble not laughing too noticably.  (There's a <a href="http://overheardinchicago.blogspot.com/">blog</a> which specializes in things overheard on Chicago mass transit.  Wouldn't you figure?)</div>
