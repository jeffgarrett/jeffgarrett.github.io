After more Pixel use, I have encountered two minor issues with easy solutions to share.<br /><br />Firstly, the clock was off by two hours this morning. Since it was previously correct, and the timezone was set properly, I suspected an underlying NTP problem. But I found <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chromebook-central/Gw5d_iZtPZc">this thread</a> suggesting that the timezone setting is ignored in favor of the (unset) apps domain timezone setting. After setting the domain timezone, the time was correct again.<br /><br />Secondly, hiding Gmail labels by dragging them into the "More Labels" section doesn't work. I found <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/gmail/uj8lgZPWva0">this thread</a> explaining that the cause is the new "Touch-enabled" inbox view, and switching back to "Comfortable" returns the familiar behavior.</div>
