<div class='post'>
Our U-Haul broke down.  We're at a Best Western in St. Roberts waiting for a real person on the U-Haul hotline.  The BW is pretty nice.  They have a pool and free wifi, and they gave us the trucker's discount.  U-Haul however sucks.<br/><br/>How will the caped crusader get out of this one?  Stay tuned.<br/><br/>More on the whole move later.</div>
