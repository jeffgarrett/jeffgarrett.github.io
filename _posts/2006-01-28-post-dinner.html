<div class='post'>
That dinner was actually pretty fun.  I get to play a certain r√¥le for the second time this August.<br/><br/>I had a friend whose birthday was August 26...  I haven't talked to her in a few years now.  I had this really stupid way to remember her birthday.  Shortly after she mentioned it once, I was opening a new checking account.  The bank officer asked me to choose my PIN for my check card.  So I used her birthday for half of it.  You aren't supposed to use birthdays or addresses or such for PINs, but there's no way anyone would've figured it out.  To do so, they'd have to make a list of all my close friends and try all their birthdays...  Easy to remember (the PIN and the birthday!) and secure.  Besides, I used another scheme for the other half of the PIN.<br/><br/>I still have the account, but the PIN has long since been changed.</div>
