Being new to OS/X, my first concern is a usable terminal. Here are a few tips...<br /><br /><b>iTerm2</b><br />Apparently, Apple's terminal app really sucked in a previous life. It's better now, but <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>&nbsp;had a head start. One of the most useful features is "mouseless copy," i.e., copy by highlighting, which will be familiar to all Linux users. Other neat features include the &nbsp;expos√© tabs and search capabilities.<br /><br /><b>Fonts</b><br />Monaco is good. Other popular options are <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html">Source Code Pro</a>,&nbsp;a monospace relative of <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/08/source-sans-pro.html">Source Sans Pro</a>.<br /><br /><b>Color Schemes</b><br /><a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized</a>&nbsp;is available for iTerm2 and vim. Here are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/ColorGallery">other options</a>.<br /><br /><b>Mind Blowing</b><br />The potentially awesome feature of iTerm2 is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/TmuxIntegration">tmux integration</a>! You can attach to tmux sessions, and have their windows treated as normal tabs. It is a killer feature. A special patched version tmux is required, and it has plenty of drawbacks, but it's new. I've used screen over tmux in the past, but this could be worth the change.</div>
