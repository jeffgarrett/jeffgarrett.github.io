I promised an update.  Here it is:  Thursday after the move I went to talk to a guy about a job.  I've been talking with him and his company since, and long story short I start Wednesday.<br/><br/>I've seen a few old friends since I've been back.  A week ago, Texas Rob and I went to play pool, and then WS and we showed up unannounced at Matt's place.  Matt's now married, so we met his wife who we all happened to know through Heidi.  His sister also visited.  Anyways, late night there...<br/><br/>OK, so that was rather short.  But that's what you get...  :)</div>
