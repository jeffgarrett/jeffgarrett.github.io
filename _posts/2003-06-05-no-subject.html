<div class='post'>
So tomorrow is the last class day of the quarter. Mohammed and I have a deal: I bring a Jack Daniels bottle to class (containing whatever I like) and drink from it, and Mohammed shaves his head and beard. Sounds like I've got the easy end of the deal. I don't know if there will be alcohol, I don't have that much left. We'll see.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the quarter is coming to the end. I've got to write up all the homework I neglected to previously, and generally I'm screwed. I wonder if I'll pass or not. And then I get to make up the P* in geometry, and there's a move coming up, and of course finals...<br/><br/>And all we seem to do lately is play bridge. Every time there's 4 people. And Robert always is frustrated when he's my partner. I think I might eventually drive him to suicide. His suicide note will read "4 clubs ?!?!".<br/><br/>Oooh, and I've got to pick an advisor soon. And tomorrow is my last chance to get Kate to skip class. And Karen and I never bowled again this quarter despite us both wanting to at the beginning. And Mike G and I and Boris and the like never went out to the city and found ethnic food and such... This quarter has been hectic.<br/><br/>But all will be over soon, all will be over soon, all will be over soon, all will be over soon, all will be over soon, all will be over soon, all will be over soon, all will be over soon, all will be over soon, all will be over soon, all will be over soon...</div>
