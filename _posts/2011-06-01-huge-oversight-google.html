Yay, I just got an invitation to Music Beta.<br /><br />However, they <i>don't</i> support Linux, so I can't use it.<sup>1</sup><br /><br />I can see the logic behind not supporting Linux. It is only 1-5% of the desktop market. But it is announced at a developer conference, where I'm sure the Linux market share was a bit higher. And among new technology adopters, I'm sure Linux market share is a bit higher. New products need adoption, and you don't really want to prevent that because of what seems to be an oversight.<br /><br />Google makes plenty of good web apps (and a handful of crappy desktop apps). They couldn't have done this in Chrome?<br /><br />Their inability to come to an agreement with music labels and their poor choices in implementation do not bode all that well for the service. A lesson for us all.<br /><br /><sup>1</sup>Without fuss.</div>
