A Hulu commercial for IE9 shows a number of flattering quotes, including "IE9 is amazingly fast," from no less than the New York Times.&nbsp;That doesn't seem right.<div><br /></div><div>A search suggests this quote came from a September 2010 blog article, <a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/microsofts-new-browser-is-pretty-cool-no-seriously/">"Microsoft's New Browser Is Pretty Cool. No, Seriously."</a>&nbsp;The context of the quote is awesome (emphasis added):</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">First and foremost, IE9 is amazingly fast. Past versions of Internet Explorer always seemed bloated and slow, especially compared to Google‘s Chrome. But I’ve been using both for a week, and Microsoft’s browser <b>keeps up</b> with Chrome on my PC. (Full disclosure: Microsoft lent me an <b>up-to-date laptop</b> that shows off IE9 better than the bargain-priced netbook I usually work on.)&nbsp;</blockquote>&nbsp;And this is what they chose for the commercial!</div>
