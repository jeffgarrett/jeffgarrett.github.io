So yesterday I spent some time with part of my old bridge crowd.  Four hours of staccato conversation.  It was nice to see them again.  We suggested future soirees.  I wish I were more certain of my future...<br/><br/>Then Rob and I went to go play pool at the usual place.  Call it practice for playoffs.  You know what happened?  We were charged for pool.  (The bartender working didn't know us.)  It brings up an interesting moral question:  if they so regularly give us free pool, can we expect it?  (Also, a former manager essentially offered everyone in the league free pool--but he no longer works there.  He didn't <em>promise</em> anything though.)  I really don't care, but Rob was incensed.  I'm certain he's going to embarrass me.  I have friends there.  Why can't everyone be so laid back as I? :)</div>
