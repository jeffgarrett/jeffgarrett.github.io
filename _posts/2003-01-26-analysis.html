Another day, and very little analysis done. Maybe an all-nighter is in store. Or a pitiful result upon grading.<br/><br/>Meanwhile we razed Andy's eye-sore of a bookshelf. The puzzle at the office is still in its box wrapped in plastic, and I have yet to put up the dart board. (Tomorrow, Tuesday, ?)<br/><br/>Bert wore his blue scarf today. N.E. offered a kick to the shin for repeatedly calling her 'Nora Elizabeth'. And in a completely unexpected move, Bert named his 8th worm "Norbert". Awesome.<br/><br/>I wonder when the next pub outing will be. I could use one.<br/><br/>The paper I couldn't find the other day was my list of books. I found it. And I typed it up. Turns out I have 47 math books.<br/><br/>Oh, and Matt and Mike Geline and I gossiped about Bert and N.E. for hours after they left, all on Bert's desk.<br/><br/>Got an excellent grenade shot in Worms today.<br/><br/>...</div>

That&#39;s a funny thing for you to say, miss nora elizabeth, since you are so sheepish about public displays of affection... like the time when I called you and Bert on holding hands under the table in the pub. That was funny. Also, my desk is suprisingly comfortable, isn&#39;t it?</div>

A dartboard. Mathematicians throwing sharp objects. Words cannot express. Eek. I mean, we&#39;ve already seen what we can do with blunt, inflatable objects.</div>
