style="align: left; height: 245px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 5px; width: 131px;"></iframe><br />After <a href="http://blog.jgarrett.org/2011/01/getting-things-done-with-gmail.html">setting up Gmail to get things done</a>, I spent some time with the book. &nbsp;I may be late to the party, as everyone seems to know the essentials already.<br /><br />The gist of the GTD philosophy is to always stay focused on the next action which can be done on any given project. &nbsp;Projects are defined liberally to be anything which consists of a series of one or more actions. &nbsp;For example, renewing my driver's license is a project with at least three steps: &nbsp;find out what documents I need, gather the documents, and finally go to the DMV. &nbsp;Since each step depends on those before, at any point in time only one action can be taken. &nbsp;On the other hand, clearly some projects have many actions which can be taken in parallel.<br /><br />The premise is that it doesn't make sense to keep all those non-actionable items on your mind. &nbsp;They should be waiting in the wings until you can act on them. &nbsp;Once you consider only the actions you can take&nbsp;<i>now</i>, you can stop worrying quite so much.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />Getting your projects into the system is a process:<br /><br /><b>Collecting:</b>&nbsp; Collect every email, piece of paper, magazine, or other object relevant to a project or just reminds you of one into one place, your inbox.<br /><br /><b>Processing:</b>&nbsp; Determine the projects and next actions associated with each object in your inbox. &nbsp;If there is no relevant project, then the object is trash or should be filed as reference material.<br /><br />As you process, and also as you regularly review your projects, you can decide among the following options:<br /><br /><ul><li>Drop it: &nbsp;It's not important.</li><li>Do it: &nbsp;If the next action takes under two minutes, just do it.</li><li>Defer it: &nbsp;File it away for the future.</li><li>Delegate it: &nbsp;Hand it off.</li></ul><br />Alternatively, the next actions are noted, and it stays with you.<br /><br />The natural extension then is to track also the context of next actions. &nbsp;After all, actions may have constraints other than dependencies on other actions. &nbsp;For example, when renewing my driver's license, gathering all the required documents is really something that must be done at home.<br /><br />I found in my short experience the Gmail GTD solution was inadequate.<br /><br />First, superstars are not supported in the Gmail Android application. &nbsp;This leaves me unable to process emails as they arise, which is disappointing. &nbsp;Second, my email does not map well to actions or projects. &nbsp;I receive emails from bug trackers, so I may have three different email threads each with useful information, but for which I only have one action. &nbsp;Third, I have a substantial amount of work outside of email. &nbsp;I have to find a way to track that in any case.<br /><br />I have abandoned the Gmail GTD system, and now use the Priority Inbox. &nbsp;I have resigned to keep track of projects outside of email.<br /><br />So I have been experimenting with <a href="http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2008/05/guest-post-advanced-gtd-with-remember-the-milk/">GTD in RememberTheMilk</a>. &nbsp;I haven't strayed far from the linked post, but I will describe what I'm doing.<br /><br />In RTM, there is an Inbox list, which serves the role of the GTD Inbox. &nbsp;If I cannot process an idea immediately, this is where it waits. &nbsp;Usually the Inbox stays empty.<br /><br />I have two lists p-Daily and w-Daily where I put actions for projects which only consist of one or two actions. &nbsp;The "p-" prefix is for personal tasks and the "w-" prefix is for work tasks. &nbsp;For example, I have a recurring task in "p-Daily" which reminds me to blog. &nbsp;I also have an "l-" prefix for lists of things which are not in the GTD system, e.g. groceries.<br /><br />For each project consisting of many actions, I have a separate list. &nbsp;For example, I have a list "p-License" to track the task to renew my license described above. &nbsp;In each of these per-project lists, I create a task with priority 1, which means it shows up at the top and highlighted, saying exactly what the project is. &nbsp;It should be something well-defined (i.e. it should be easy to know when it is done). &nbsp;This project-defining task is treated specially, not tagged. &nbsp;When I complete the project, I remove the priority 1, and complete this task (and archive the list).<br /><br />For all other tasks, I have the following tags:<br /><br /><ul><li>na - this is a next action</li><li>@computer - this task needs a computer</li><li>@internet - this task needs internet access</li><li>work - this task is for work</li><li>wait - this task is waiting on something</li></ul><br />And I have the following locations:<br /><br /><ul><li>@home - my home</li><li>@work - my work</li></ul><br />All tasks are be assigned to a location if relevant and tagged with one or more tags. &nbsp;I set time estimates for all tasks. &nbsp;I set due dates for tasks which need to be done in a certain timeframe, or just soon.<br /><br />Finally, I have some smart lists for contexts:<br /><br /><ul><li>@Braindead = tag:na AND timeEstimate:&lt;60m (easy tasks)</li><li>@Computer = &nbsp;tag:na AND tag:@computer</li><li>@Home = &nbsp;tag:na AND location:@home</li><li>@Internet = tag:na AND tag:@internet</li><li>@NoComputer = tag:na AND NOT tag:@internet AND NOT tag:@computer</li><li>@NoInternet = tag:na AND NOT tag:@internet</li><li>@Work = tag:na AND (location:@work OR tag:work) AND NOT dueAfter:"2 weeks from today"</li></ul><br />And I have some smart lists for reports:<br /><br /><ul><li>[Overdue] = tag:na and dueBefore:today</li><li>[PersonalStatus] = completedWithin:"2 weeks of today" AND NOT tag:work</li><li>[Today] = tag:na and (due:today or due:tomorrow)</li><li>[WorkStatus] = completedWithin:"2 weeks of today" AND tag:work</li></ul><br />And I have a smart list of all actionable tasks:<br /><br /><ul><li>All Tasks = tag:na</li></ul><br />The search operators are very flexible and you can find&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/answers/search/advanced.rtm">a full list of them here</a>.<br /><br />I use the&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/glcdefibajbglmeelclffdbakgjjjopc">A Bit Better RTM Chrome extension</a>&nbsp;to tweak the web interface which adds a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-m) for moving tasks between lists, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/2160/remember-the-milk-readable-list">RTM Readable List user style</a>&nbsp;which darkens and enlarges the list font. &nbsp;On the go, I use the wonderful RTM Android application.<br /><br />I've been using this for a few weeks. &nbsp;I think it works. &nbsp;:)</div>

For implementing GTD you can use this web application:<br /><br />http://www.Gtdagenda.com<br /><br />You can use it to manage your goals, projects and tasks, set next actions and contexts, use checklists, schedules and a calendar.<br />Syncs with Evernote, and also comes with mobile-web version, and Android and iPhone apps.</div>
