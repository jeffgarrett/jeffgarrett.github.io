Android 4.2 is rolling out to Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 devices. If you're impatient, there's a trick which worked for me:

 * Go to Settings<
 * Disable Wifi
 * Go to Apps, then to All
 * Find Google Services Framework
 * Force Stop
 * Clear Data
 * Go back to Settings
 * Enable Wifi
 * Go to About phone/tablet
 * Go to System updates
 * Check now
 
 Your mileage may vary.
