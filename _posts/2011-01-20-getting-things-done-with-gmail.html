I've shared&nbsp;<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5321180/turn-gmail-into-your-ultimate-gtd-inbox">this lifehacker post</a>&nbsp;in my Reader shared items already, thanks to SdC, but it is life-changing. &nbsp;Enable multiple inboxes and superstars in GMail and go through the steps and you can have a nicely organized inbox like this:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hSTKmooxduo/TTfinPU0zyI/AAAAAAAAABI/ybcXgSKgPBo/s1600/gmail_gtd.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="231" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hSTKmooxduo/TTfinPU0zyI/AAAAAAAAABI/ybcXgSKgPBo/s400/gmail_gtd.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />This rakes in a lot of positive shoulder-surfing comments, and it's productive. &nbsp;I would also suggest enabling keyboard shortcuts. &nbsp;The shortcut "s" will iterate through the superstars. &nbsp;The inboxes on the right panel do not refresh immediately, but you can always force this with "gi".</div>
