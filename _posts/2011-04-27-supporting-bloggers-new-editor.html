One of my annoyances with the user script for typesetting LaTeX in Blogger was how it just didn't work with the new editor (otherwise known as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jeffgarrett/browser-extensions/issues/7">issue 7</a>).<br /><br />No more!<br /><br /><br /><img align="middle" alt="\int_0^1 x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}" border="0" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\int_0^1 x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}" /><br /><br />(This post was written in the new editor!)</div>
