I just saw quite the interesting <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0118702/">movie</a>.  It's highly recommended!  Rent it today.<br/><br/>While I'm at it, another good movie is <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0181836/">The Specials</a>.  We've tried to rent it before, but we couldn't find it at our video store!  Can you believe that?  On a more serious note, I watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0102103/">Impromptu</a> lately.  The first two are light comedies, whereas Impromptu has a slightly heavier romantic tone.  The story regards the entanglement of George Sand and Frédéric Chopin.  Overall, it is quite a good movie.  I <em>highly</em> recommend all of these.</div>
