I <a href="http://blog.jgarrett.org/2011/01/using-latex-from-blogger.html">previously wrote</a>&nbsp;about my trivial fix to a user script for LaTeX markup in Blogger.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; Now that I've explored more, I know more options, but I still haven't found a single solution which does everything I would like.<br /><br />My primary requirement is to easily typeset math which can be read not only on the website, but also from the RSS feed. &nbsp;To that end, the user script mostly works. &nbsp;However, it doesn't look nearly as nice as MathJax.<br /><br />So, long story short, I believe there are a few more changes I want to make to the user script. &nbsp;I have decided to explore <a href="http://github/">GitHub</a> for code hosting. &nbsp;It's early yet, but it has a very nice interface.<br /><br />So if you want to follow along, see my&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jeffgarrett/browser-extensions">new repository</a>.<br /><br /><sup>1</sup>Clicking on the original link failed to automatically install the user script. &nbsp;I have fixed it.</div>
