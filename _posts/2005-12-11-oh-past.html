This blog started as a LiveJournal blog in early 2003.  My username there was <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/txaristocrat/">txaristocrat</a>.  Then earlier this summer I set up <a href="http://jgarrett.org/">jgarrett.org</a> specifically so that I could have a rather permanent, personal e-mail address.  As an added bonus, in moving my blog to the new machine, I now had <em>complete</em> control over it.  So for example, I could choose the style more freely than at LJ, or include polls, or whatever I so desired...<br/><br/>When I did this, the computer on which all of my site was hosted was one a friend of mine had set up at his job (at a web hosting company).  Near the end of the summer though, he left that job under somewhat questionable circumstances.  And he left quickly...<br/><br/>The computer was soon taken down, so what little information I had stored there I lost, including those blog entries made after moving away from LJ, as well as some e-mail, and perhaps a few other things.  I later set up my site <em>again</em> at a web hosting company where I had substantially more control.  I never moved my archival blog entries though, the few ones from the LJ days.<br/><br/>The point of this is:  now I have!  So you can now see all the blog entries (excluding those from this summer forever lost) since I've ever had a blog.</div>
