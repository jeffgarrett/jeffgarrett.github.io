I may have found an answer to <a href="http://blog.jgarrett.org/2012/11/android-42-battery-life.html">my question</a>. My battery life is back over 24 hours. Investigation suggested that it was syncing-related. I tried the following two things (after other failed attempts) based on the weak evidence I had:<br /><ol><li>Set my phone to <b>always</b>&nbsp;keep wi-fi on during sleep (under Wi-Fi, under Advanced in the menu). I have weak cellular coverage in my house, so falling back to cellular isn't necessarily better for battery.</li><li>Disable <b>Currents</b> from syncing. It is a heavy abuser, and I don't use it.</li></ol><div>Problem solved.</div><div><br /></div><div>By the way, two apps I have used for keeping an eye on battery are <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asksven.betterbatterystats">BetterBatteryStats</a>&nbsp;(good for investigation) and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hubalek.android.apps.reborn.pro">Battery Widget? Reborn! Pro</a>&nbsp;(general purpose, good for keeping an eye on drain).</div></div>
