<blockquote><br/>Well I guess that you probably know by now<br/>I was one who wanted to fly<br/>I wanted to ride on that arrow of fire right up into heaven<br/>And I wanted to go for every man<br/>Every child, every mother of children<br/>I wanted to carry the dreams of all people right up to the stars<br/><br/>And I prayed that Iâ€™d find an answer there<br/>Or maybe I would find a song<br/>Giving a voice to all of the hearts that cannot be heard<br/>And for all of the ones who live in fear<br/>And all of those who stand apart<br/>My being there would bring us a little step closer together<br/></blockquote></div>
