Bing is aggressively advertising their Bing It On challenge, the "Side-By-Side Search Off." So what do you get if you search for "side by side search off"? Here's <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=side+by+side+search+off" target="_blank">Google.</a> Here's <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=side+by+side+search+off" target="_blank">Bing.</a>

Google has Bing's challenge page as the first link. Bing doesn't even have it on the first page! Challenge lost.
