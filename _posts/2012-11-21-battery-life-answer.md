I may have found an answer to <a href="http://blog.jgarrett.org/2012/11/android-42-battery-life.html">my question</a>. My battery life is back over 24 hours. Investigation suggested that it was syncing-related. I tried the following two things (after other failed attempts) based on the weak evidence I had:

 1. Set my phone to **always** keep wi-fi on during sleep (under Wi-Fi, under Advanced in the menu). I have weak cellular coverage in my house, so falling back to cellular isn't necessarily better for battery.
 2. Disable **Currents** from syncing. It is a heavy abuser, and I don't use it.

Problem solved.

By the way, two apps I have used for keeping an eye on battery are <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asksven.betterbatterystats">BetterBatteryStats</a> (good for investigation) and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hubalek.android.apps.reborn.pro">Battery Widget? Reborn! Pro</a> (general purpose, good for keeping an eye on drain).
