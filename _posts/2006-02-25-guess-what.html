<div class='post'>
I suppose it's obvious a whole uneventful week would not pass.  CC and the workmen are supposed to come tomorrow morning.  They will put insulation along the exterior wall, fix the drywall, and hopefully move the washer/dryer back to its cubby.<br/><br/>But wait!  Another problem arises.  There is a slow, steady drip in the heater's closet.  Right now, there's a bucket below it, and much less drywall above it than once was.  CI is attempting to reach our upstairs neighbor.  Hopefully this will also be fixed tomorrow?!</div>
