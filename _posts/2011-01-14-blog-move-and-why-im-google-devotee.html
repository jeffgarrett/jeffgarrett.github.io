In the bygone days of what was 2003, I started this humble blog on Livejournal.  Friends followed.  I posted irrelevant nonsense.  All was well.  In 2005, I moved my email and blog to a privately hosted domain.<sup><span >1</span></sup>    The time has come for another shift.<br /><br />I'm ditching my personal Wordpress install for the comfort of Google Blogger.  The domain remains the same but links will change.  As a follower, you may need to update the URL for the <a href="http://blog.jgarrett.org/feeds/posts/default">RSS feed</a>.  Wordpress seems <a href="http://wpmu.org/wordpress-security-101-8-tips-tricks-and-tweaks-to-secure-your-wordpress-website/">plagued</a> by <a href="http://wpmu.org/why-you-should-never-search-for-free-wordpress-themes-in-google-or-anywhere-else/">security problems</a> in each new version and the comment spam was unmanageable.  I hope to get away from that.<br /><br />This is one more step into the Google cloud for me.  Android was the first step, then Mail &amp; Contacts, Chat, Calendar &amp; Tasks, Reader, Voicemail and now Blogger.  I know people who are still reluctant to give a third-party corporate entity so much control over their information.  But Google continues to add value.  My next lost phone won't also lose all my contacts.  Google Talk was first to bring video to XMPP.  Calendar and Reader have sharing.<sup><span class="Apple-style-span" >2</span></sup>   When Google stops adding value, that's when they'll lose me.<sup><span class="Apple-style-span" >3</span></sup><div><br /></div><div>Hopefully now, with less comment spam and administration overhead, I will post more frequently.<sup><span class="Apple-style-span" >4</span></sup><br /><br /><sup><span >1</span></sup>I cannot recommend Linode highly enough.  They are great!</div><div><sup><span class="Apple-style-span" >2</span></sup>And see <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/421348/">LWN</a> for a recent comparison of RSS aggregators.<br /><div><sup><span class="Apple-style-span" >3</span></sup>On the other hand, I still fail to see lasting value in Facebook...</div></div><div><sup><span class="Apple-style-span" >4</span></sup>Famous last words!</div></div>
