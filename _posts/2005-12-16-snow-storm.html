Maybe it's because I grew up in Texas, but there's something about snow.  Right now flakes are falling deliberately and quickly, but earlier it was sparse puffy flakes floating down.  And these little mercurial messengers always dance to the music.  Liszt's Liebestr√§ume plays softly in the background as the white dots slowly and softly paint the street in choreographed harmony.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,<br/>Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,<br/>Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air<br/>Hides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven,<br/>And veils the farmhouse at the garden's end.<br/>The sled and traveler stopped, the courier's feet<br/>Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit<br/>Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed<br/>In a tumultuous privacy of storm.<br/><br/>Come see the northwind's masonry.<br/>Out of an unseen quarry evermore<br/>Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer<br/>Curves his white bastions with projected roof<br/>Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.<br/>Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work<br/>So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he<br/>For number or proportion. Mockingly,<br/>On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths;<br/>A swan-like form invests the hidden thorn;<br/>Fills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall,<br/>Maugre the farmer's sighs; and at the gate,<br/>A tapering turret overtops the work.<br/>And when his hours are numbered, and the world<br/>Is all his own, retiring, as he were not,<br/>Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art<br/>To mimic in slow structures, stone by stone,<br/>Built in an age, the mad wind's night-work,<br/>The frolic architecture of snow. <br/></blockquote></div>
