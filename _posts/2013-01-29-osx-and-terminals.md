Being new to OS/X, my first concern is a usable terminal. Here are a few tips...

__iTerm2__
Apparently, Apple's terminal app really sucked in a previous life. It's better now, but [iTerm2][1] had a head start. One of the most useful features is "mouseless copy," i.e., copy by highlighting, which will be familiar to all Linux users. Other neat features include the &nbsp;expos√© tabs and search capabilities.

__Fonts__
Monaco is good. Other popular options are [Inconsolata][2] and [Source Code Pro][3], a monospace relative of [Source Sans Pro][4].

__Color Schemes__
[Solarized][5] is available for iTerm2 and vim. Here are [other options][6].

__Mind Blowing__
The potentially awesome feature of iTerm2 is [tmux integration][7]! You can attach to tmux sessions, and have their windows treated as normal tabs. It is a killer feature. A special patched version tmux is required, and it has plenty of drawbacks, but it's new. I've used screen over tmux in the past, but this could be worth the change.
