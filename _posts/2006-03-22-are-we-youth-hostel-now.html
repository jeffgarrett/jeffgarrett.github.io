About two weeks ago, Q's Ukrainian friends stayed here for a few days.  Then this past weekend, N had 3 college buddies and his brother over for the weekend--for his "bachelor party."  (I do not think I saw his brother sober <em>ever</em>.)  Then last night when I come home, there's some guy sleeping on the couch--one of Q's friends.<br/><br/>Anyone else need a place to stay?</div>
