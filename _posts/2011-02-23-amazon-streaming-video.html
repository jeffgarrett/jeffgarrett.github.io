Amazon announced their new streaming video service last week, and it is included in Amazon Prime at <i>no additional cost</i>.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/prime">Amazon Prime</a> membership costs $79 annually and offers free two-day shipping and cheap one-day shipping on most items.  Now, it also offers instant streaming video.  I thought Prime membership was worth the cost prior to the announcement.  It's only better now.<div><br /></div><div>I'm already contemplating closing my Netflix account.  I pay $16 a month ($192 annually) for the option of receiving two DVDs at a time.  Netflix costs more, doesn't include cheap Amazon shipping, and <i>doesn't offer me streaming videos</i>.  Amazon doesn't have the same selection yet, but the section <i>is</i> big (and it is <i>free</i> for me!).</div><div><br /></div><div>Amazon supports streaming videos from day one on Linux, my platform of choice, but Netflix doesn't think that the Linux market (probably 1-5% of computer desktops) is big enough for them. According to Netflix execs, "Netflix can't be everything to everyone."  Fair enough.</div></div>
