What better honor exists for a French general than to lend his name to a kid's game?  I went to the contest at Sheffield's yesterday.  It was best 2 out of 3, and I was out in the first round with my first two throws:  paper and rock.  Aside from the contest, there was a Sierra Nevada tasting.  The ladies nearby sampled <em>all</em> of the options, while trying to fend off a persistent suitor.<br/><br/>The place is rather nice.  I watched Olympic skating on their 106" screen.  They have a pool table, and supposedly it is free until 9 p.m.  I didn't try it though.  They have a <em>large</em>, reasonably priced selection of beers.  I think Rob would've found himself right at home.  I had a great time.</div>
