Here's a brain teaser (h/t Rob):<br /><br />You start at the center of a disc-shaped pond. &nbsp;A wolf is at the edge of the pond, and the wolf runs four times as fast as you can swim. &nbsp;He will always run along the edge toward the spot that's closest to where you presently are. &nbsp;How do you get out of the pond without the wolf there to eat you?</div>
