I suppose I never finished the story.  CC and the workmen came over at around 10 a.m. on Monday.  It wasn't quite as simple as I had hoped.  CC wanted to put a shutoff valve in our apartment.  So she called the plumber, and we waited a few hours for him to show.  CC waited in her car for a bit, and then we watched some early Seinfeld episodes together.  Finally, the plumber arrived, and they spent some time trying to figure out <em>how</em> to put a shutoff valve in our apartment.  The plumber gave CC an estimate (which was larger than she thought), and she decided not to do it for a while.  Then the workmen fixed the drywall, and moved the washer/dryer back to its place.<br/><br/>Overall, it only took about 5 hours.  Relatively quick...</div>

5 hours for a shutoff valve installation is not bad at all. I&#39;ve seen situations where plumbers have a hard time outfitting those kind of valves in places that were never designed to get outfitted by shutoff valves. I assume the cost is appropiate for work time and installation quality.</div>
