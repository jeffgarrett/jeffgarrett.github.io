no really. proving all this analysis stuff related to poisson summation is kinda fun. still got to see if i can talk about riemann roch without introducing adeles...<br/><br/>if K is a function field over a finite field, A_K is a locally compact group, and K embeds in it, and A_K/K's dual is naturally isomorphic to K, so it's just like usual fourier stuff with Z and R/Z^ = Z ...<br/><br/>sorry<br/><br/>anyways, working on this, riemann roch is basically poisson summation over K and A_K/K^ with a (translation) twist... and then interpreted geometrically... and i want to talk about this, and it should be fun</div>
