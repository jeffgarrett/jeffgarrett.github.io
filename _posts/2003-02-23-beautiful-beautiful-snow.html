<div class='post'>
I walked home about an hour ago. Late night and all with some of the analysis and such things. But it was snowing. The snow sparkled on the ground, as if it were glittered with bits of shiny silvery glitter. I can tell this will be a wonderful day.<br/><br/>And regarding my last entry, it wasn't so bad. Apparently only 2 first yrs attended the party. Rob says I was missed at happy hour. But a lot of my favorite people showed up at the office this weekend.<br/><br/>All is copacetic.</div>
