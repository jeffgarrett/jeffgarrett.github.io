This place is so frustrating.  When that interloper made his appearance, the landladies came over very quickly, and brought the contractors.  They sealed up the basement, and the next day the contractors fixed the hole in the wall.  A few days after, the landladies changed the padlocks on the side and back gates.  They made sure to give us keys (but we almost never use these gates).<br/><br/>At some point between then and now, they replaced the door (and locks) to the basement.  All nice and good, except we don't have access.  Our circuit breakers are in the basement.  Since we run space heaters constantly (because it's so drafty and cold), this presents a serious problem.  Our first circuit has already paid his fare to Charon.  (OK, that's over the top.)  Let's see how long it takes, and how many circuits die before we get keys to the basement.</div>
