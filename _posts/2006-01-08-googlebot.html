<div class='post'>
I've tried this <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps">Google sitemaps</a> thing now for a few months.  At the very least, it hasn't hurt.  I do wish more statistics were available.<br/><br/>One thing I can't figure out:  why does Googlebot see my site as US-ASCII?</div>
